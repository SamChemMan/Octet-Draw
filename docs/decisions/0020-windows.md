# 0020: A window for each drawing

Status: built 2 November 2026, as Sam asked.

Octet had one window. Home covered the drawing, and opening a drawing replaced the one that was open. Sam asked for
more than one drawing open at a time, each in a window of its own, with Home listing the open windows.

## What others do

- ChemDraw 26.1 has a window for each document. New Document and Open Document open a new window. On Windows its
  toolbar has Cascade, Tile Horizontal and Tile Vertical (`~/octet-research/notes/chemdraw26-inventory.md`).
- Mac document apps (TextEdit, Pages) open a file into an untouched empty Untitled window instead of a new one.
- ChemDraw 22.2 starts in a document window; files opened later open in windows of their own.

## Decision

- Home is the window `main`. Each drawing has a window `draw-1`, `draw-2` and on (`src-tauri/src/windows.rs`).
- The first drawing opens in Home's window, as Octet's one window did (Sam, 3 November 2026). Once a drawing is open,
  what opens from Home or from a drawing window opens in a new window. A window that holds an untouched new drawing
  takes the next one instead, and so does Home's window when no drawing window is open. Opening several files at once
  puts the first in that window and each of the others in a window of its own.
- Home has an Open windows section first, with each window's name, picture and state (Edited, Saved, New). A click
  brings the window to the front. A drawing that is open already comes to the front instead of opening twice.
- File > Home in a drawing window brings Home to the front, and opens it again if it was closed. When Home's window
  holds a drawing, Home shows over it, as File > Home does in that window.
- Menu commands go to the window in front. Each window sends its ticks, colours and fonts when it comes to the front;
  the menu bar is built again only when a list changes. The Window menu lists the open drawings, with a tick on the
  one in front: on the Mac the system lists the windows, and on Windows and Linux Octet lists the drawings that Home
  lists (issue 73).
- Quit asks about each window with unsaved changes in turn; Cancel stops it. The Dock's Quit and a logout do the same.
- Recovery keeps a copy for each window (`<session>z<window>`). Settings are shared through storage events.
- Files from Finder open one window each. A file dropped on a drawing goes into that drawing.

## Not done

Cascade and Tile (ChemDraw's Windows toolbar). The operating system already arranges windows (Sam, issue 73).
