// Octet as an OLE server on Windows: double-click a drawing in Word and Octet opens it,
// edit it, and Word's picture changes (issue #24).
//
// ole.rs makes the object: the streams that hold a drawing and the picture a host shows.
// This file is the other half, the part that answers when a host wants the drawing edited.
//
// What happens when the user double-clicks an embedded drawing in Word:
//
//   1. Word reads our class id from the object's storage and asks COM for the class.
//   2. COM reads LocalServer32 from the registration (ole.rs register) and starts Octet
//      with -Embedding, unless an Octet is already running and has registered its factory.
//   3. Word gets IClassFactory and asks it for an object.
//   4. IPersistStorage::Load reads the CONTENTS stream: the drawing, as a .oct holds it.
//   5. IOleObject::SetClientSite, then DoVerb, and we open an Octet window on the drawing.
//   6. The user edits and saves. The window hands the drawing back (`embedded_save`), we
//      ask the client site to save us, Word calls IPersistStorage::Save, and we write the
//      streams again — the new drawing AND a new cached picture, so the page changes.
//   7. The window closes, we tell the site, and Word takes its object back.
//
// Octet is an "outside-in" server, as ChemDraw is: it edits in a window of its own rather
// than inside Word's page. That is why GetMiscStatus returns no OLEMISC_INSIDEOUT, and why
// the registration has the Edit and Open verbs and nothing else.
//
// Threading, which is the part that has to be right.
//
// The objects live on a thread of their own: a single-threaded apartment with a message-only
// window and a message pump (`offer_class`). COM marshals every call from a host into that
// thread's queue, so the calls arrive one at a time and in order, and the objects can hold
// plain `RefCell` state and the host's own interface pointers.
//
// That only holds because every object a host is given says `Agile = false`. windows-rs makes
// an implemented object agile by default: it answers IAgileObject and hands out an IMarshal
// that marshals it to any apartment, which tells COM the object is safe to call anywhere, so
// calls are delivered on RPC worker threads instead of here. This was written that way at
// first and it broke quietly in both directions: the `RefCell` state was touched by two
// threads at once, and a pointer the host passed in — IOleClientSite — belonged to the RPC
// thread that passed it, so calling it back from here failed with RPC_E_WRONG_THREAD
// (0x8001010E). In Word that looked like a page that never redrew after an edit: SaveObject
// answered that error, so Word never called IPersistStorage::Save and never re-fetched the
// picture.
//
// Registering the class from Tauri's main thread instead does not work, and does not fail
// loudly either: that thread is not an STA, so COM treats Octet as a free-threaded server
// and delivers calls on RPC worker threads, several at once. The first attempt did that, and
// the first call Word made came in on a thread-pool thread and took the process down.
//
// Work crosses into the apartment by posting to its window, never by calling into it:
//   - `hand_back` (from the `embedded_save` command, on a Tauri worker thread) leaves the
//     drawing in HANDBACK and posts WM_HANDBACK.
//   - The task that opens a drawing window leaves its label in WINDOWS and posts WM_OPENED.
// Work crosses the other way through Tauri, which takes calls from any thread: nothing in
// here may block, so DoVerb spawns the window and returns at once.
